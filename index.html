      <h1>Hi! I’m Derrick 👋🏿👋🏻 am SHY</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a graphic designer with a passion for making things look good. I'm
        also pretty funny, so if you're looking for someone to design your next
        marketing campaign, you've come to the right place. Just don't expect me
        to take myself too seriously. I am a creative and innovative thinker
        with a strong attention to detail. I am always looking for new ways to
        improve my skills and knowledge.
